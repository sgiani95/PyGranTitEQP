# Project Milestones for PyGranTitEQP

This document outlines the verbose milestones for developing **PyGranTitEQP**, a Python module for processing potentiometric titration data to detect equivalence points using Gran and Schwartz methods. The module supports a command-line interface (CLI) for routine batch analysis and a graphical user interface (GUI) for method development, aligning with requirements for usability, performance, and chemometric precision. Milestones are structured to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) early, followed by advanced features, testing, and deployment. Estimated timelines assume a single developer working part-time (~20 hours/week), adjustable based on resources.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and Planning
- **Goal**: Establish the project foundation, finalize the module name and requirements, and set up the development environment to ensure a smooth start.
- **Tasks**:
  - Confirm module name as **PyGranTitEQP** (or finalize an alternative, e.g., `py_tit_gran_sch_pip`).
  - Refine requirements: Confirm specific Schwartz formula (e.g., V * (10^(pH - pK) - 1) for weak acid-base titrations) and supported titration types (e.g., acid-base, complexometric).
  - Create project structure: Set up directories (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `examples/`) for a Python package.
  - Initialize Git repository (e.g., on GitHub) for version control.
  - Set up development environment: Install Python 3.8+, dependencies (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tkinter), and virtual environment.
  - Draft initial documentation: Create README with project overview, installation instructions, and planned features.
  - Define coding standards: Follow PEP 8, with camel-case for module branding (e.g., **PyGranTitEQP**) and lowercase for internal functions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Git repository with initial structure (e.g., `src/pygrantiteqp/__init__.py`, `tests/`, `docs/`).
  - Finalized requirements document (updated from *Gran_Schwartz_Titration_Requirements.md* if needed).
  - `setup.py` for package installation with dependencies listed.
  - README.md with installation steps and project scope.
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1–2 weeks (10–20 hours).
- **Rationale**: A solid foundation ensures alignment with your chemometric goals, clarifies the Schwartz formula, and sets up a maintainable codebase. Early documentation supports usability for both CLI and GUI workflows.

## Milestone 2: Core Functionality (MVP) – CLI for Gran and Schwartz Endpoint Detection
- **Goal**: Develop a functional CLI prototype that processes titration data, computes endpoints using Gran and Schwartz methods, and generates basic visualizations, serving as the MVP for routine analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Data Input**: Implement file reading for CSV, Excel (.xlsx), and text files using Pandas, expecting columns for titrant volume (mL) and response (e.g., pH or mV).
  - **Preprocessing**: Add functions to clean data (remove outliers, handle missing values), smooth noise (e.g., Savitzky-Golay filter via SciPy), and validate inputs (e.g., monotonic volumes, pH 0–14).
  - **Gran Processing**: Implement Gran functions (e.g., F1 = V * 10^(pH - 14) for strong acid-base) and support for polyprotic systems (first/second Gran plots).
  - **Schwartz Processing**: Implement Schwartz formula (e.g., V * (10^(pH - pK) - 1) for weak acid-base, customizable via user inputs like pKa).
  - **Endpoint Detection**: Use SciPy’s linear regression to identify linear regions in Gran/Schwartz plots and compute endpoints via intersections.
  - **Basic Analysis**: Calculate equivalence volume, analyte concentration, and linear fit metrics (e.g., R²).
  - **CLI Interface**: Use argparse to accept inputs (e.g., `--input data.csv`, `--method gran|schwartz|both`, `--titrant-conc 0.1`).
  - **Visualization**: Generate plots (raw titration curve, Gran/Schwartz plots with endpoints) using Matplotlib, saving as PNG/PDF.
  - **Testing**: Write basic unit tests (pytest) for data processing, Gran/Schwartz calculations, and endpoint detection.
- **Deliverables**:
  - CLI script (e.g., `pygrantiteqp --input data.csv`) that outputs endpoint volumes, metrics, and plots.
  - Sample dataset (e.g., synthetic CSV with volume/pH) for testing.
  - Unit tests covering core functions (~50% coverage).
  - Documentation update: CLI usage examples in README.
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3–4 weeks (30–40 hours).
- **Rationale**: Delivers a working MVP for routine batch analysis, meeting your CLI requirement. Focuses on core chemometric functionality (endpoint detection via Gran/Schwartz), enabling early validation with real or synthetic data.

## Milestone 3: GUI Development for Method Development
- **Goal**: Create an interactive GUI for method development, allowing parameter tuning, endpoint visualization, and validation, tailored to chemists refining Gran/Schwartz analyses.
- **Tasks**:
  - **GUI Design**: Use Tkinter to build a user-friendly interface with:
    - File picker for input data (CSV/Excel).
    - Input fields for parameters (e.g., titrant concentration, pKa for Schwartz, smoothing window).
    - Dropdown for method selection (Gran/Schwartz/both).
    - Plot display area for interactive Matplotlib canvases.
  - **Interactive Visualization**: Show raw titration curve, Gran/Schwartz plots, and endpoints, with zoom and tooltip support.
  - **Parameter Tuning**: Add sliders or inputs for adjusting linear region selection, smoothing parameters, and Schwartz constants (e.g., pKa).
  - **Endpoint Validation**: Allow manual adjustment of linear regions and confirmation of calculated endpoints.
  - **Export Options**: Include buttons to save plots (PNG/PDF) and results (CSV/text).
  - **Testing**: Write unit tests for GUI components (e.g., event handlers, plot updates).
  - **Documentation**: Add GUI usage guide with screenshots to README.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Standalone GUI script (e.g., `pygrantiteqp_gui.py`) with interactive features.
  - Updated README with GUI instructions and examples.
  - Unit tests for GUI functionality.
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3–4 weeks (30–40 hours).
- **Rationale**: Fulfills your GUI requirement for method development, enabling chemists to tune parameters and visualize endpoints interactively, leveraging your interest in usable chemometric tools.

## Milestone 4: Advanced Features and Comprehensive Testing
- **Goal**: Enhance the module with advanced features (batch processing, simulation, multi-endpoint support) and ensure reliability through rigorous testing.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Batch Processing**: Extend CLI to process multiple files (e.g., `--input-dir data/`) and generate summary reports comparing Gran/Schwartz endpoints.
  - **Simulation Mode**: Add functions to generate synthetic titration data (e.g., theoretical pH curves for strong/weak acid-base titrations) for testing.
  - **Advanced Endpoint Analysis**: Support multiple endpoints (polyprotic systems), compute uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals via error propagation), and compare Gran/Schwartz results.
  - **Enhanced Visualization**: Add comparison plots (Gran vs. Schwartz endpoints) and statistical metrics (e.g., R², standard deviation).
  - **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for edge cases (e.g., noisy data, non-ideal curves, multiple endpoints) and both methods (~80% coverage).
  - **Performance Optimization**: Ensure processing of 10,000-point datasets in <5 seconds (per requirements) using profiling (e.g., cProfile).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Updated CLI with batch processing and simulation mode.
  - Enhanced GUI with advanced visualization and analysis options.
  - Comprehensive test suite (~80% coverage).
  - Performance report for large datasets.
  - Updated documentation with advanced feature guides.
- **Estimated Timeline**: 4–5 weeks (40–50 hours).

    - Theory: Explain Gran and Schwartz methods with references.
    - API reference: Document all functions/classes (e.g., using Sphinx or Markdown).
    - Tutorials: Include examples for CLI batch processing and GUI parameter tuning.
  - **Packaging**: Finalize `setup.py` for PyPI distribution, listing dependencies (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tkinter).
  - **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify compatibility on Windows, macOS, Linux with Python 3.8+.
  - **User Guides**: Provide step-by-step instructions for CLI/GUI, including sample datasets and expected outputs.

  - Cross-platform test report.
  - Optional: PyPI release or GitHub repository with release notes.
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2–3 weeks (20–30 hours).
- **Rationale**: Ensures the module is user-friendly, shareable, and professional, meeting your usability requirements for both method development and routine analysis.
